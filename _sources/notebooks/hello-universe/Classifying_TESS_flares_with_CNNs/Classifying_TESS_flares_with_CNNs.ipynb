    "## Introduction\n",
    "CNNs are a class of machine learning (ML) algorithms that can extract information from data. In this notebook, you will walk through the basic steps of applying a CNN to data:\n",
    "1. Load the data and visualize a sample of the data.\n",
    "2. Divide the data into training, validation, and testing sets.\n",
    "3. Build a CNN in `Keras`.\n",
    "4. Compile the CNN.\n",
    "5. Train the CNN to perform a classification task.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the CNN performance on test data with a confusion matrix.\n",
    "7. Build a new, unlabeled dataset and apply the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs can be applied to a wide range of vector analysis tasks, including classification and regression.\n",
    "Here, we will build, compile, and train CNN to classify whether a star has undergone a flaring event from its observed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ([TESS](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/)) 2-minute light curve, and where the flaring events are located within the time series.\n",
    "This work is based on the model described in the [`stella`](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JOSS....5.2347F/abstract) software package.\n",

    "**NOTE:** *The [`stella` team has publicly-available code and documentation](https://adina.feinste.in/stella/) for demonstrating the architecture and optimal performance of this model, which we encourage you to check out!\n",

    "- **Why does the data near gaps have a high probability of being flares?**\n",

    "When there's a gap in the data, the first 100 points can't be centered in each example properly.\n",
    "As such, `stella` cannot accurately predict flares in these data and skips it.\n",

    "- **But what if there are flares near the data gaps?**\n",
    "There may very well be flares towards the data gaps!\n",
