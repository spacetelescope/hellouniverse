    "# An AI-Powered Light Curve Similarity Search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier on variable star light curves from [TESS-SPOC](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tess-spoc), then extract embedding vectors to build a light curve similarity search database. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional light curve data searches are conducted based on metadata---stellar parameters like effective temperature or radius, light curve measurements like amplitude or photometric precision, etc. However, astronomical phenomena don't always fit nicely into these metadata. For example, eclipsing binary light curves can come from any type of star system, regardless of their stellar parameters. Queries for these types of targets must be done on the features of the light curves themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enormous wealth of time series photometry from space missions like Kepler, K2, TESS, and soon Roman presents a major challenge to astrophysics investigations that must analyze individual light curves. Analyzing the ~24 million light curves from the first two years of TESS alone, without high performance or multicore computing, would take over nine months at a single second per light curve. Faster, more intelligent algorithms are necessary for bulk analysis in a reasonable timeframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents the end-to-end development of a light curve similarity search database powered by machine learning. In such a fast-searching vector database, users can choose a target or upload a light curve and quickly retrieve a desired number of “similar” targets. In this case, similarity is determined using the Euclidean distance in a space of \"embedding vectors\" which are extracted from a layer of a trained neural network. For our light curves, we will use the MAST High Level Science Product [TESS-SPOC](https://archive.stsci.edu/hlsp/tess-spoc), which consists of full-framge image light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) processed by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) pipeline. In its search for transiting exoplanets, TESS measures light curves for millions of stars, which are useful for identifying stellar astrophysical phenomena like rotation, flares, and binary eclipses.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the similarity search database, each light curve has an associated embedding vector, which consists of some number (in this case 64) of floating point values. This means that the database is relatively small compared to the size of a full light curve database. To find light curves similar to a desired target, the target embedding vector is compared to all of the vectors in the database using the Euclidean distance, which is also a fast and lightweight computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the similarity search, we must do the following:\n",
    "1. Choose a training set\n",
    "2. Preprocess the training data\n",
    "3. Build a CNN classifier\n",
    "4. Train the CNN\n",
    "5. Evaluate the CNN performance\n",
    "6. Extract the embedding vectors and demonstrate a similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",

    "## 0. Set configuration parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The cell below contains parameters that the user can use to configure the notebook run. First and foremost, the notebook contains two large computations: processing light curves into wavelet power spectra, and training the CNN. Both of these steps are precomputed, so they are not re-run by default. However, if you want to change any configurations and re-run them, you can by setting either of the first two variables to `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other parameters include labels for the CNN run, which you can change so as not to overwrite existing save files, as well as CNN configurations: training batch size, early stopping patience, and the number of epochs to train for. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN exhibits a configurable number of convolution filters in each layer. In theory, more filters let you extract higher order features, but it can also result in overfitting. There are pre-defined configurations in the cells below (see the `channels` dict), where the configuration is set by `RUN_NUMBER`. We use the simplest configuration by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "`DEVICE` is the device on which to train the CNN. By default, it's the CPU, but if you have access to a CUDA-enabled GPU, you could swap \"cpu\" for \"cuda\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`LOSS_FUNCTION` is Cross Entropy by default, but you can also experiment with other loss functions. See [the PyTorch documentation](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html#loss-functions) for the possibilities."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we developed a light curve similarity search using a CNN classifier to learn and export feature embeddings from the light curves. We selected and processed training data, built and trained the CNN, extracted the embeddings, and showed an example of a similarity search. Similarity Searches are powerful because they do not rely on metadata in the same way classical database queries do. Instead, they rely only on features of the data. This kind of search can empower users to build science samples without needing to know *a priori* what kinds of objects produce the features they see in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we used a single CNN configuration to build the similarity search, but there are other configurations and choices that may be enlightening. For example,\n",
    "1. Use different numbers of convolution filters by changing `RUN_NUMBER`, or if you're feeling daring, manually configure the CNN channels.\n",
    "2. Train on fewer training classes by removing a column from `TRAINING_COLS`. You may find that adding or removing classes affects the classification accuracy.\n",
    "3. Use different \"test\" examples for the similarity search. Do the returned light curves look similar?"
