    "# Classifying flaring stars with stella: a convolutional neural network for TESS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this tutorial, you will see an example of building, compiling, and training a CNN to classify astronomical data in vector form.**\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial you will have a working example of a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in `Keras`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "CNNs are a class of machine learning (ML) algorithms that can extract information from data. In this notebook, you will walk through the basic steps of applying a CNN to data:\n",
    "1. Load the data and visualize a sample of the data.\n",
    "2. Build a CNN in `Keras`.\n",
    "3. Compile the CNN.\n",
    "4. Train the CNN to perform a classification task.\n",
    "5. Evaluate the CNN performance on test data with a confusion matrix.\n",
    "6. Build a new, unlabeled dataset and apply the CNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs can be applied to a wide range of vector analysis tasks, including classification and regression.\n",
    "Here, we will build, compile, and train CNN to classify whether a star has undergone a flaring event from its observed Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite ([TESS](https://www.nasa.gov/tess-transiting-exoplanet-survey-satellite/)) 2-minute light curve, and where the flaring events are located within the time series.\n",
    "This work is based on the model described in the [`stella`](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JOSS....5.2347F/abstract) software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** *The [`stella` team has publicly-available code and documentation](https://adina.feinste.in/stella/) for demonstrating the architecture and optimal performance of this model, which we encourage you to check out!\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to step through the model building and training process.* \n",
